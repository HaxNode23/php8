# PHP: The Right Way

## What?

There's a lot of bad information on the Web (I'm looking at you, W3Schools) that leads new PHP users astray, propagating bad practices and bad code. This must stop. _PHP: The Right Way_ provides an easy-to-read, quick reference for PHP best practices, accepted coding standards, and links to authoritative tutorials around the Web.

## How to Contribute

_PHP: The Right Way_ is hosted on GitHub Pages. It is a Jekyll project available in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/codeguy/php-the-right-way/tree/gh-pages) branch. Fork and edit the [gh-pages](https://github.com/codeguy/php-the-right-way/tree/gh-pages) branch, add some examples or helpful links, and send me a pull request. Let's make this the best resource available for new PHP programmers!

## Why

There's been a lot of discussion lately about how the PHP community lacks sufficient, credible information for programmers new to PHP. This repository aims to solve this problem.
