PHP supports first-class functions, meaning that a function can be assigned to a variable.
Both user-defined and built-in functions can be referenced by a variable and invoked dynamically. 
Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions and a 
function can return other functions ï¿½(a feature called higher-order functions).
