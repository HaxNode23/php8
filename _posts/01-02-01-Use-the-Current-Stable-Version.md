## Use the Current Stable Version (7.1) {#use_the_current_stable_version_title}

If you are getting started with PHP, start with the current stable release of [PHP 7.1](php-release). PHP 7.1 adds many amazing [new features](#language_highlights) over the older 5.x versions. The engine has been largely re-written, and PHP is now even quicker than older versions. Migration paths are [described in the PHP manual](php-migration-guides).
