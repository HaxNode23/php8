## Tutorials {#tutorials_title}

With a huge push as of 2010 for people to learn PHP, there's been an increase of immersive and sometimes interactive tutorials. Many of these offer a complete, if only higher-level, understanding of PHP. Like other resources from the Internet, they are made with the best of intentions, but don't necessarily teach the best practices. The following is a list of those that take its students down the right path.

Like the Books section, this section also aims to be a living document for recommended books on PHP development in general. If you would like to recommend a tutorial, send a PR and it will be reviewed for relevancy.

* [Hacking with PHP](https://hackingwithphp.com/) - This website is itself a living document, currently updated for PHP 5.6. Paul Hudson presents an in-depth guide to PHP, its history, and its use cases.
* [Object-Oriented PHP for Beginners](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/object-oriented-php-for-beginners--net-12762) - Objected-oriented programming (OOP) has become a hugely popular paradigm. This tutorial presents common OOP topics in PHP.
