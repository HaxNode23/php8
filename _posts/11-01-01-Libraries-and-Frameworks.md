# Libraries and Frameworks

### Libraries
A framework independent PHP classes. Some of them are 

* [Aura Project](https://github.com/auraphp)
* [Symfony](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/index.html)
* [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/)

You can search [packagist.org](http://packagist.org) for more independent libraries

## Web Frameworks

Rather than re-invent the wheel, many PHP developers use _frameworks_ to build out web applications. Frameworks abstract away many of the low-level concerns and provide helpful, easy-to-use interfaces to complete common tasks.

_You do not need to use a framework for every project_. Sometimes, plain PHP is the right way to go. But if you do need a framework, here are a few of the most popular ones (in alphabetical order):
