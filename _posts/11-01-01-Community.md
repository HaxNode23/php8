# Community

The PHP Community is widely know welcoming new members and being a very supportive group of people ready to help each
other and contribute to other projects. All of the best practices being shared here are common topics in User Group
meetings and Conferences all over the world.

If you plan on being a serious developer who wishes to grow professionally, participating in these efforts are a fail
safe path to success. User Groups are present in many places of the world, from Brazil to the US, over to Europe and all
the way down in Australia. Work is still ongoing to have a centralized list, so Google and Meetup are your best places
to start a search.

Around the community we have a saying: *"If you can't find a User Group in your area, its your turn to start one"*. We
are also very supportive of new groups and try to share tips and advice and generally support them to get them going. If
you decide to take this on, be sure to visit the [UG Admins](https://wiki.php.net/usergroups) mailing list and introduce
yourself.

Also be sure to check out conferences and meetings in your area, PHP has an [official
calendar](http://www.php.net/cal.php) which is a good place to start. Get out there, meet new developers, learn new
topics and above all, make new friends.
